# FAQ

## Will this mod be ported?

**Q: Will this mod be ported to version x.x.x or other mod loaders?**

**A:** We are only going to focus on Forge 1.16.5 and 1.18.2 (hopefully) as of now, **thus there
will be no plans for backports or Fabric/Quilt releases**. However, if you want to port everything
from the mod yourself or with a group of people, feel free to fork the project. You may not
redistribute any version of the mod on other websites but if you request it we may put your version
on our website.

## Who started/made this?

**Q: Who started/made this?**

**A:** This was started as an idea from the admins of
the [formerly named DangerZone modding Discord](https://discord.gg/hs6FJEDtMd), about a small while
after the official OreSpawn update was cancelled due to social media drama. This became to grow in
its own path, and hopefully it keeps doing so.

## Missing Orespawn elements

**Q: Could you please add <insert base OreSpawn element(s) here>?! This isn't OreSpawn without
it/them!**

**A:** We aren't porting everything from OreSpawn in its pure form, and so not only thought is
needed to remake that content, it also means that some content will not make the cut.

Unlike the original creator's belief, this has nothing to do with the Minecraft EULA (which states
they own the content, but you own what you make), and we aren't removing the end-game content or
lock them behind a 'forever beta' paywall. This has to do more about the more notorious features,
such as the Girlfriend and Boyfriend NPCs.

Going through development of the mod, we may change things here and there, sometimes in a smaller
scale, other times in a large scale. **We won't be porting the original OreSpawn for copyright
reasons.**

If you want the **original mod** with no changes, please instead play the actual OreSpawn mod, via
either [DangerZone/DangerZone VR](https://www.orespawn.com/download/), or
[the older versions for Minecraft V1.5-1.7](https://dangerzone-archive.weebly.com/orespawn.html).

## Different look from Orespawn

**Q: Why do the assets look so different from OreSpawn? If not, will there be a way to get them?**

**A:** The creator of
OreSpawn, [Richard H. Clark (TheyCallMeDanger)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_Tsf31uosncmWCICYO52Dw)
, has commented on our former CurseForge page to not use the assets that were created for his mod,
as seen in the image below.

**Therefore, not only we're not going to use the OreSpawn assets, we're also not going to provide,
promote or endorse any resource pack that attempts to port them.**
