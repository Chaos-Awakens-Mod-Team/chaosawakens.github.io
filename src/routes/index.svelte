    <h1>Chaos Awakens is a Spiritual Successor of OreSpawn!</h1>
    <p>Chaos Awakens is a remaster of both the very iconic mod OreSpawn and SoulsOfTheFallen's Chaos Awakens mod pack, built from the ground up.</p>
    <p>The Chaos Awakens project was created after the 1.12.2 OreSpawn update was cancelled. The staff of the DangerZone Modding Discord decided to start their own version of the mod and found some people wanting to help. These people were some extremely talented Coders, Modelers, Texturers and more.</p>
